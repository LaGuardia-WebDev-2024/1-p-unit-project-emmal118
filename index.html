    <h1>What Are Some of the Best Foods I Recommend?</h1>

    <p>
      Do you ever get so hungry you would eat just about anything? Well if this
      happens to you, you're in luck you found this website. I'll be sharing a
      list of my top eats, so you can pick what sounds good!
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Sushi! Sushi is one of my favorite foods, simply because it tastes so
        good! You can go to a sushi restaurant, or even at your local
        supermarket, it's tasty, fun, and easy!
      </li>

    
        <li>
          Tacos! I love tacos simply because of how good they taste, and not to
          mention how easy they are to make!
      </li>
    </ul>
